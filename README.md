## Description

The user can view the entire employee directory at once so that they have quick access to their information. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees.

## Installation

- npm i

## Usage

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user can:

- Sort the table (alphabatize)
- Filter the users (i.e. search "kelly" or "felicia" )
